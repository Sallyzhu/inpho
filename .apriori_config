# This is a very simple and inflexible configuration file of apriori implementation!
# Please modify only the integers in the beginning of the next three lines!
0   # "1" if quiet mode is required
1   # "0" if reduced baskets should not be stored in memory
2   # "0" if no size threshold is given

# This configuration file was created so that I can get rid of platform specific 
# command line processing (getopt in the case of linux). This way this implementation contains only 
# standard c++ command, hence it can be compiled on every platform.
#
#
# Description of the values set by this script:
# quiet mode     : if it is 1, than no system messages will be written out during the process.
# reduced_basket : if it is 1, than reduced baskets (basket from infrequent item are deleted)
#                              will not be sorted and stored in memory. This reduces memeory need,
#                              but slows down the algorithm.
# size threshold : The user can specify the maximum size of the itemsets that have to be mined. 
#                  For example size if this threshold is 3, then only frequent items, itempairs, 
#                  and itemsets of size 3 will be searched for.
#                  If this value is 0, then no threshold is used, and all frequent itemsets
#                  will be found.
