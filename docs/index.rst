Welcome to InPhO's documentation!
=================================
The `Indiana Philosophy Ontology (InPhO) Project
<https://inpho.cogs.indiana.edu>`_ is a pragmatic attempt to model the
discipline of philosophy using an iterative three-step process known as 
**dynamic ontology**:

1.  **Data mining** - Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are used to
    generate statistical hypotheses about the relations among various topics in
    the SEP.
2.  **Expert feedback** - These hypotheses are evaluated by domain experts through
    online interfaces.
3.  **Machine reasoning** - The feedback is combined with the statistical measures
    as a knowledge base for our machine reasoning program, which uses answer set
    programming to output a taxonomic view of the discipline.

Before starting this process, a *term list* and *seed taxonomy* must first be created.
The *term list* can be auto-generated by using the `inphosemantics package
<http://github.com/inpho/inphosemantics>`_. It can be extracted from a current
inpho database by using the command ``python inpho/corpus/idea.py --export [-f
filename]``.
